# My portfolio
This portfolio was created as an excercise during Technigo beginner coding boot camp. 

# What and how
The challenge was to follow a very detailed, pre-defined design and making every element appear as expected. It was a thourogh practice in CSS and responsiveness, and also an introduction to web accessability and the tools available to check your code and design. The portfolio will be continously updated which provides for an oportunity to sharpen the code each time.
